# Attendance Tracker

## Purpose
This simple app tracks attendance for the given names and sessions entered. The tracker is written with javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The app is an example of an **MVC design pattern**. Users can enter the number of days (or sessions) and add students to the class roster.

**Please note:** because this application uses local storage, the data will not persist (as in a database). This project was merely and exercise to refactor some old code and use an MVC design pattern. The program is made for mobile and desktop views.

## Background
